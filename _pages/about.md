Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Simon Fraser University. My Ph.D. research focuses on understanding the association of two stochastic processes, with applications in public health and sports analytics. My general research interests lie in Bayesian statistics, sports analytics, and biostatistics. Beyond academia, I'm the co-founder and chief data scientist of [AccMov](https://www.accmov.com/), a sports technology startup. I'm also a powerlifting athlete registered with the Canadian Powerlifting Union ([CPU](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/kangyipeng)) and the 2024 British Columbia provincial champion in the bench-only category.
