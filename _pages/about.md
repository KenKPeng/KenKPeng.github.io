Welcome! I recently received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Simon Fraser University, where I was supervised by Prof. X. Joan Hu and Prof. Tim Swartz. My research focuses on statistical modeling for dynamic and latent-process systems, with applications in environmental public-health surveillance and sports analytics. I am broadly interested in Bayesian methods, stochastic-process modeling, and biostatistical methodology.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow working with Prof. Robert Delatolla’s group at the University of Ottawa, where my work centers on developing spatio-temporal models for wastewater-based surveillance to support public-health decision making.

Beyond academia, I'm the co-founder and chief data scientist of [AccMov](https://www.accmov.com/). I'm also a powerlifting athlete registered with the Canadian Powerlifting Union ([CPU](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/kangyipeng)) and the 2024 British Columbia provincial champion in the bench-only category.
